# UFO sightings data analysis and visualisation

## Data source
The dataset used for this analysis can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonwright13/ufo-sightings-around-the-world-better). It consists of UFO sightings reported in the United States spanning the years 1993 to 2013. 
The author of the dataset on Kaggle obtained the original data from NUFORC.org.

## Scripts

The original dataset already had a well-structured format and was cleaned, so I only filtered the sightings reported in the USA during 1993-2013.
Then, I added a `day` column and changed the `month` column from a number to a string.

Both scripts can be found in the `scripts` folder.

## Visualisation

I aimed for a clean and engaging visualization. You can view the final result here or in the `visualisation` folder. Enjoy!
